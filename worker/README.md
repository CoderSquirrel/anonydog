Core anonymizer
====
This is a proof of concept for the core anonymizing component in anonydog.
It creates an anonymized list of git commits by changing the author field
from the source commits.

The rest will be _just_ pumbling. ;-)

Running
----
    $ bundle update
    $ bundle exec ruby hello_world.rb
