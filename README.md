# anonydog
Woof! On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.

Is your identity influencing the way project mantainers look at your pull
requests? I can help you answering that question!

I'm a bot (or a dog -- you'll never know for sure) that helps you stay
anonymous on github.

To use me:

1. Go to https://anonydog.org/fork and tell me which github repo you want to
   work on.
2. Instead of forking `anyuser/anyrepo`, fork `anonydog/anyuser-anyrepo`
3. Create a branch and work as you normally would
4. When you're done, open a pull request to `anonydog/anyuser-anyrepo`

When I see that, I'll flip a magical coin and either (1) open the pull request
to the original repo on your behalf or (2) strip your name from every possible
author field and submit a pull request under my own name.

Don't worry. If your pull request gets accepted, I will reveal your github
handle and you'll get credit for it.
