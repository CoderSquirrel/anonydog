# anonydog

Woof! On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.

Is your identity influencing the way project mantainers look at your pull
requests? I can shed some light on that question!

I'm a bot (or a dog -- you'll never know for sure) that helps you stay
anonymous on github.

To use me:

1. Go to https://anonydog.org/fork and tell me which github repo you want to
   work on.
2. Instead of forking `anyuser/anyrepo`, fork `anonydog/anyrepo`
3. Create a branch and work as you normally would
4. When you're done, open a pull request to `anonydog/anyrepo`

When I see that, I'll flip a magical coin and either (1) open the pull request
to the original repo on your behalf or (2) strip your name from every possible
author field and submit a pull request under my own name.

Don't worry. If your pull request gets accepted, I will reveal your github
handle so that you can get credit for it.

## Motivation

This, as most things, started as a [conversation][2]. @isislovecruft mentioned
that they had been testing gnupg developers by using male and female pseudonyms.
It didn't take long for someone to suggest automating that.

What would happen if a bot automatically anonymized opensource contributors?

What if it could randomly choose between anonymizing and _not_ anonymizing?

Will some demographic groups get code merged more/less frequently when they're
anonymous?
