# anonydog
Woof! On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.

I'm a bot (or a dog -- you'll never know for sure) that helps you stay
anonymous on github.

To use me:

1. Go to https://anonydog.org/authorize and authorize me to talk to
   github on your behalf (I promise I won't do anything nasty)
2. Fork anyuser/anyrepo on github
4. Create a branch and work normally
5. echo 'anyuser/anyrepo' > Anonydogfile
6. Open a pull request to `anonydog/anyrepo` (instead of `anyuser/anyrepo`)

If you do that, strip your name from author fields everywhere, submit a pull
request to the original repo on your behalf and delete your branch. Only if
your pull request gets accepted, I will reveal your true identity and you'll
get credit for it.
