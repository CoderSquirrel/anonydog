## Get in touch

At this stage we don't have any code yet. If you're interested,
[open an issue][1] and we'll talk.

## Motivation

This, as most things, started as a [conversation][2]. @isislovecruft mentioned
that they had been testing gnupg developers by using male and female pseudonyms.
It didn't take long for someone to suggest automating that.

What would happen if a bot automatically anonymized opensource contributors?

What if it could randomly choose between anonymizing and _not_ anonymizing?

Will some demographic groups get code merged more/less frequently when they're
anonymous?
